# Soonaverse collection galery example
Let's have some fun store. This is heavily in progress.

See example: [here](https://soonaverse.github.io/soon-portal-angular/) 

## Angular setup

Let's first install the Angular CLI. It's a neat tool Angular provides that automates many development tasks. To install it, open a terminal and type the following command:

`npm install -g @angular/cli`

Once installed, create a new project with the following command:
`ng new soon-portal-angular`

A prompt will appear asking you if you want to enable strict mode. Select yes. This will enable a few other settings that will help to catch bugs ahead of time.

In your directory you now see your project repo. Type the following commands to go in it:
```
cd soon-portal-angular
ng serve --open
```
ng serve will build the app, while the --open option will open up a browser to `http://localhost:4200/`. You should now see Angular generic template page.

### Customizing the html template
Now that the general project setup is done. Let's start customizing it within components.

Afterwards, the browser should reload instantly, displaying only the new title.

#### Customizing the stylesheet

For help with our styling, we will use the angular material components. These components made by the material team are an implementation of [material design](https://material.io/). They will allow us to quickly create a fast, design tested e-commerce.
